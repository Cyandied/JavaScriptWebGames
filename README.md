# WebGames
This project started because my mum likes mastermind, but doesnt like ads, and did you know you can set up a webserver on an iphone? And even set it up so it auto-pulls from this very repository each time you open the webserver app? I sure didnt, but now I do, so now I create games for my mum she can play, 0 ads, 0 interupts, 100% fun!

However the project grew and it became a sort of challenge. Make up puzzle games and implement them as an option in the games selector... Mobile compatabily optional... The caviat is that all games should be fully playable WITHOUT a webserver, and no compilers either. These games are made with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 0% AI and 100% fun!
